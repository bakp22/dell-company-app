# Database Project
This project is a site developed with Vercel and JavaScript in COMP-305: Software Development at Kalamazoo College. 
I am taking the time to modify it after the class had finished.


## Purpose
-> The goal is to draft a full Full-Stack Web application and later refine it with React. 

## Updates
As of now, I am updating the project; the update log is below.

- August 8th, 2024 -> Finalized adding NavBar and resolving changes to clean the UI of the front page.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
